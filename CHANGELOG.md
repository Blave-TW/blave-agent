# Runtime changelog

Queued-for-release state lives HERE, not in anyone's memory: any commit that
changes `runtime/` adds a line under **Unreleased** in the same commit. At
publish time, bump `VERSION`, move the Unreleased lines under the new version
heading, and ship — the file sits next to `VERSION` so the publisher cannot
miss it. (Channel rules: `.claude/docs/blave-agent-update-channels.md`.)

## Unreleased

- report_uploader: new — the machine's only path from a report JSON to
  `PUT /openclaw/agent/report/<id>`, and the owner of the drop-dir contract
  (`workspace/reports/<id>.json`, written atomically, id = file stem). Runs a
  deliberately looser-than-api contract check before spending a request and
  writes every refusal — local or the api's own 400 — to
  `workspace/reports/upload_errors.log` so the machine's agent can read what it
  got wrong. Uploaded reports move to `reports/sent/`, permanently refused ones
  to `reports/failed/`; transient failures back off (60s→1h) and retry
  indefinitely. No Telegram here — the summary push is platform-side
  (`agent_reports._notify_stored`), so sending from the machine too would
  double every alert. This file's existence is also what flips
  `strategy_reporter._can_report()` true fleet-wide.
- report_uploader: report figures now ride along in a sidecar directory,
  `workspace/reports/<id>.files/` — an `image` block carries `{"file":
  "equity.png"}` and this process uploads the bytes (same strategy_image
  channel, now via the public `strategy_reporter.put_image`) and rewrites the
  field into `sha256`. Producers need no token, which is the point:
  `command_listener._strategy_subprocess_env()` strips every `BLAVE_*`, so a
  scheduled script could not PUT an image at all — and scheduled research
  figures are what the block exists for. Failure semantics split three ways:
  a producer mistake (missing file, non-image extension, 0/>2MB) refuses the
  whole report, anything transient defers it intact, and only a 507 image
  quota drops the block and ships the rest (logged, plus the quota marker the
  agent raises in chat). Sidecars move with their report into `sent/` /
  `failed/`; orphaned ones are swept after a day. Contract:
  `.claude/docs/report-blocks.md` §2.5.
- performance_report: new — deterministic, zero-LLM daily/weekly performance
  reports. Hourly: samples account equity into
  `workspace/state/equity_history.jsonl` (same cadence and per-venue rules as
  the platform's `agent_equity_snapshot`) and drops `daily-YYYY-MM-DD` /
  `wk-YYYY-MM-DD` in the drop dir when the period they cover has ended. Reads
  disk products only (`manager/account.json`, `manager/last_reconcile.json`,
  `strategies/*/{state,stats}.json`) — never `workspace/lib/`, which may be
  arbitrarily old. Missing inputs cost blocks, not the report; mixed-currency
  accounts degrade rather than invent an fx rate.
- performance_report: the weekly risk grid now tags each metric with the
  contract's `metric_table.items[].format` — untagged items render neutral, so
  without it the signed ones (年化報酬, 最大回撤) lose their up/down colour.
  Needs an api that accepts the field (same release train as the rest of this
  section); an older api refuses the whole report with 400.
- file_watcher: watches the reports drop dir (Windows stand-in for the new
  `blave-agent-reports.path`).
- jobs.json: `blave-agent-reports` (uploader, 2 min + path/dir trigger) and
  `blave-agent-perfreport` (hourly) on both Linux and Windows.

## 1.1.51

- strategy_reporter: the change watcher's live-strategy exemption now also
  covers strategies in the deployment registry (state/deployments.json,
  wait_for_bar/cron) — web-deployed strategies run with BLAVE_MODE=live and
  keep MODE="backtest" in the file, so per-bar stats.json rewrites were
  firing a ~0.5MB strategies chunk every bar, around the clock (uid=32321,
  116MB replay buffer). Registry read is fail-open.
- portfolio_reporter: strategy figures now carry `ran_at` (stats.json mtime).
  The workspace page uses it to judge "would a re-run help" — backtests run
  within 24h are never flagged stale, making holiday closures a non-issue
  (web fallback until this ships: weekday-lag rule, immune to weekends only).

## 1.1.50

- web_bridge: strategy change watcher — polls strategy_reporter.signature()
  every 3s so BYO-agent backtests reach the workspace in seconds instead of
  the 2-min reporter timer. (Recorded retroactively — shipped without a
  changelog entry; its draft-strategy blind spot is fixed in 1.1.51.)

## 1.1.49

- strategy_reporter: side-rail breathing dot now covers Type A/C in-process
  scheduler runs (previously only crontab entries were scanned).
