# Runtime changelog

Queued-for-release state lives HERE, not in anyone's memory: any commit that
changes `runtime/` adds a line under **Unreleased** in the same commit. At
publish time, bump `VERSION`, move the Unreleased lines under the new version
heading, and ship — the file sits next to `VERSION` so the publisher cannot
miss it. (Channel rules: `.claude/docs/blave-agent-update-channels.md`.)

## Unreleased

## 1.1.51

- strategy_reporter: the change watcher's live-strategy exemption now also
  covers strategies in the deployment registry (state/deployments.json,
  wait_for_bar/cron) — web-deployed strategies run with BLAVE_MODE=live and
  keep MODE="backtest" in the file, so per-bar stats.json rewrites were
  firing a ~0.5MB strategies chunk every bar, around the clock (uid=32321,
  116MB replay buffer). Registry read is fail-open.
- portfolio_reporter: strategy figures now carry `ran_at` (stats.json mtime).
  The workspace page uses it to judge "would a re-run help" — backtests run
  within 24h are never flagged stale, making holiday closures a non-issue
  (web fallback until this ships: weekday-lag rule, immune to weekends only).

## 1.1.50

- web_bridge: strategy change watcher — polls strategy_reporter.signature()
  every 3s so BYO-agent backtests reach the workspace in seconds instead of
  the 2-min reporter timer. (Recorded retroactively — shipped without a
  changelog entry; its draft-strategy blind spot is fixed in 1.1.51.)

## 1.1.49

- strategy_reporter: side-rail breathing dot now covers Type A/C in-process
  scheduler runs (previously only crontab entries were scanned).
